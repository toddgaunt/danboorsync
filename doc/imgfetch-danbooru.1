.SH SYNOPSIS
.B imgfetch-danbooru [-p <range>] TAGS...
.PP

.SH DESCRIPTION
Download pictures from danbooru.domnai.us with the provided
.IR [tags] .
.PP
The download directory is specified by the toplevel imgfetch command. Within this directory, more sub-directories are created according to the character tags on the images downloaded. This means if you download from 
.B http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tags=hatsune_miku
with the output directory 
.BR download , 
the directory
.IR download/hatsune_miku ,
will be created with all images tagged 
.B hatsune_miku 
downloaded there. 
.PP
Character tags are concatanated, so if there is an image with the tags 
.BR hatsune_miku\ asuka ,
a directory 
.I download/hatsune_miku-asuka
will be created for those images. If an image is missing character tags, it will be downloaded to 
.IR download/no_character_tag .
